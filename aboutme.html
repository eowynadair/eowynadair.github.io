              <p>My name is Eowyn Adair. Obviously I'm not entirely sure what I strive to do yet, but at this moment I would like to be an Information Security Analyst. I think I would enjoy this job because it could test not only my abilities, my ego as well. I know that seems selfish, but we should do what we want a job. Being an Information Security Analyst would mean I would be creating systems to avoid breaches, or other forms of hacking into a network;etc. This is my first year with no experience in the field of coding but I plan on pursuing a career and going to college.</p>
              <p>A couple of characteristics I posess include music, and setting up devices. I can somewhat play the piano which in some way can relate to typing on a keyboard because of pressing on the keys. I have also been able to set up PC's in the past when my parents bought a new one. Normally when the television stopped working, I would be the one to find the wires that were placed wrong and I connected them back in the right spot. So far, in high school, I haven't really accomplished much. I was homeschooled for 9th grade and did no extracurriculars. My goals for this year though is to get more involed in outside activities involving Computer Science and having a better understanding of it overall. I also want to enter into a film festival called DIGICOM. I don't really have much work experience, all I have done is baby sit and rewire televisions for older people. I haven't ever been apart of a club or any other activities that have to do with Computer Science.</p>
              <p>Basically, I am new at this. I hope to excell in my studies and move forward only gaining more knowledge of the world of Computer Science. Thank you for stopping by and feel free to check out the rest of my site!
